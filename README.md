# XenoX Multiverse

We're making things official with the beginning of XenoX Multiverse. Team XenoX started as my dream, just a small team of devs working on open-source projects for the fun of it. But over the months, it has grown bigger and stronger. So with this, I want to formally announce the Team XenoX open source initiative. This is where the master list of all the projects and all the devs collaborating on XenoX will live.

If you want to be one of us, just write your name and you're in!

## How to join the Team? 💪🏼

1. Fork the repo.
2. Add your name to this file.
3. Submit a pull request.

That's it. You're all set. Someone from the team will contact you and formally welcome you to the team. Cheers!
